        <p>
            <p>This article first appeared in "Towards Data Science," a Medium publication on data science, machine learning
                and AI. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-college-acceptance-with-ai-6d8abd702385">See the original article with over 6 thousand claps here.</a></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Around this time last year, I was busy rattling away on my keyboard, applying to colleges around the globe. As
                I filled out the seemingly endless application in front of me, it occurred to me that this was wholly inefficient
                and risky.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Each year, over 2 million college applications are filed, and each of them comes with a certain element of chance.
                Even students of the highest academic caliber apply with an element of randomness, and often face difficult
                situations as a result — the intended meritocracy inherent in college admissions gives way to uncertainty,
                doubt, and anxiety.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Of course, many factors influence admission, but it’s no secret that two factors heavily weigh in on determining
                acceptance: GPA and SAT/ACT scores. While other factors are certainly taken into consideration, it is statistically
                and practically undeniable that these two metrics hold incredible importance to a student’s application — although
                no one truly knows how these are judged and filtered by colleges.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But at the end of the day, these two metrics are metrics: numbers that can be easily assessed using data science
                to analyze trends and relationships. And so, being extremely impatient and as anxious as I am, I decided
                to attempt to <b>predict college acceptance</b> rather than wait for decisions to roll out. And while there
                are thousands of statistical methods to analyze the trends between GPA/test scores and application outcome,
                I chose a recently popular predictive method: Machine Learning.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Machine Learning is a broad field with many solutions and applications, but I honed in particularly on Artificial
                Neural Networks. Seeing as my inputs were entirely numeric and my output could be one-hot encoded into a
                binary value (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted), an ANN worked out quite nicely.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After implementing an architecture in <a href="http://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a>, I trained my network on
                a dataset gathered for Carnegie Mellon in particular (just an example, with some 90 datapoints). After approximately
                150,000 iterations (~1 minute on a GeForce 1060 GPU), I was able to reach an accuracy between <b>75–80%</b>.
                While this may not seem that accurate, it is significant enough to draw some conclusions, and definitely
                functions better than arbitrary linear models.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>
            <p>From the commandline I was able to gather some pretty decent results on college acceptance:</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>After that I made a GUI using bootstrap (sorry):</p>
            <p></p>

            <p></p>
            <p>All in all, it proved somewhat useful in not only calming my anxiety but filtering my applications to limit them
                to which schools I was likely to get into. <i>Ironically, it even predicted my rejection from Carnegie Mellon!</i></p>
